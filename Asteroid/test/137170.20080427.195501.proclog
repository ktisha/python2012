(*) Main object flags:
  "*" - possible target
  "?" - unidentified object
  "R" - astrometric reference star
  "P" - photometric reference star
  "-" - discarded/unused reference star


(**) Internal object flags:
  ast_refstar    - astrometric reference star (contributes to LSPC solution)
  ast_discarded  - discarded/unused astrometric reference star
  phot_refstar   - photometric reference star (contributes to differential photometry solution)
  phot_discarded - discarded/unused photometric reference star
  trail          - PSF fitting performed in the trail measurement mode
